# Descriptive analysis of demographic data

TheInternational Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau contains various demographic data from 1950 to the present (and projections until 2060) for over 200 countries with a population of 5,000 or more. The underlying data are based on the respective countries’ official demographic statistics—e.g. in form of censuses, surveys, administra tive records—or on estimates and projections by the U.S. Census Bureau itself. Thedatasetinthefilecensus_2022_2002.csv containsasmallextractfromtheIDB. It includes life expectancy at birth and total fertility rates for 228 countries from 2002 and 2022. For the exact definitions of these variables see https://www.census.gov/ programs-surveys/international-programs/about/glossary.html. Life expectancy is stratified by sex. The countries are divided geographically into 5 regions and 21 sub regions.
